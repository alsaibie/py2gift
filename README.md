# py2gift
> Make input files for <a href='https://github.com/manuvazquez/gift-wrapper'>gift-wrapper</a> programmatically


This library is meant as a *companion* for [gift-wrapper](https://github.com/manuvazquez/gift-wrapper). The latter is meant to
> Build GIFT (Moodle compatible) files easily

but still you need to write the questions *by hand*. This library encompasses some utilities to ease the process. The ultimate goal is to write the exams in [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.
It has been created using [nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev).

## Install

#`pip install py2gift`

## How to use

Fill me in please! Don't forget code examples:

```python
1+1
```

The images are underneath handled by *gift-wrapper*, and hence either `.tex` (that can be compiled with *pdflatex*) or `.svg` files are fine.

The difference between two instances of the same question can be minor or significant. Ultimately, it depends on how sophisticated your Python code is (if the latter can solve the question/problem in a very general form, and you are also able to present it in the `statement`, you are good to go).
