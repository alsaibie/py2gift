In every case *variables*, specified with the prefix `!` can be included, and those are meant to be *filled in* from within a Python class. This comes very handy when you want to create different versions of a single question in which some input data (maybe in the form of a picture) changes from question to question. Then, you can instruct `py2gift` to call your run your python code a number of times, each one giving rise to a different version of the same question."

Moreover, they can be included through one of the variables (prefix `!`), and hence random (but nonetheless meaningful) pictures are a possibility."
